# What are Amniotes?
[Amniotes](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/29%3A_Vertebrates/29.03%3A_Amphibians/29.3C%3A_Evolution_of_Amniotes#:~:text=The%20first%20amniotes%20evolved%20from,ago%20during%20the%20Carboniferous%20period.) are a group that evolved millions of years ago from amphibians during the Carboniferous period. They are [tetrapods](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tetrapod), meaning animals with a spinal chord and four limbs.
Amniotes can be divided into 3 groups: Synapsids, Diapsids, and Anapsids.

## Synapsids
[Synapsids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsida) are a group that include all mammals as well as extinct species like Moschops and Dimetredon.
They have a single temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye socket, leaving a bony arch beneath each.
All this means is that they have one hole behind each eye in their skull. This hole is where jaw muscles attach, helping them bite and chew better.

## Diapsids
[Diapsids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapsid) include birds, dinosaurs, and reptiles. They have two openings in the skull, allowing them to have larger, stronger jaw muscles and open their mouths wider. Some can even dislocate their jaw to swallow larger prey (todo: source)

## Anapsids
[Anapsids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapsid) are amniotes that do not have a temporal fenestra/skull opening. The only living example is turtles, although most modern paleontologists agree that turtles actually evolved from diapsid ancestors and later lost their temporal fenestra.
